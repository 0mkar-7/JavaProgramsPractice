Polymorphism
Many forms

2 types 
staic --> Compile Time--->methoad Overloading
dynamic ---> Run time --->Methoad overriding


Method Overloading --> process of extending the existing feature 

Abstraction
Abstract class is a collection of two methods , concrete and abstract methods.
We canno create reference varable for abstract class.
It is not required to have abstract methods in abstract class.
We cannot create pbjects of abstract class.
Even without concrete methds abstract class can work.
Abstract clss is partially incomplete.

Interface:
Interface is a collection of abstract methods.
It is fully incomplete.
We cant create object of Interface
Keyword to create interface is ' interface '.
By Default all the variables in the interface  are public static final.
By Default all the methods are abstract and public .
To define the body of the abstract methods of Interface in the class we use ' implements ' keyword.
Multiple Inheritance is possible with help of Interface.
